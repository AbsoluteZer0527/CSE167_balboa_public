Computer graphics is the field that studies how to process \emph{visual data}, such as shapes, volumes, and lights. \textbf{Images} are an important class of visual data: they can be the pictures recorded by the camera of your cellphone or a DSLR, outputs of video games or movie visual effects, legends and arrows on Google map telling you where to go next, or visualization of the radio waves coming from a black hole. An important subfield of computer graphics, rendering, studies the generation of images.

\end{figure}

In our first homework, we will implement a 2D renderer that takes a set of simple shapes (circle, squares, and triangles), and turn them into a raster image (\cref{fig:render2d}). A raster image is a particular kind of image that represent 2D contents using a grid of \emph{pixels}, where each pixel denotes the color at that location. Raster images are convienient because our displays (and our camera sensor) usually also represent images as a grid of pixels.

Before you start coding, we recommend you to go through the whole handout to have some ideas of what needs to be done.

\paragraph{Submission.} Submit your code and the outputs of your code through Canvas. In addition, for the quizzes below, answer them through the Gradescope (you can access it through Canvas).

\paragraph{Grading.} We will compare your outputs to our reference solutions. The points of the quizes are included in the total points on the section titles.

\paragraph{Colloboration policy.} We expect you to write the code on your own. Feel free to discuss between the peers and ask us questions though!
